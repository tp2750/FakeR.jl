_Fake it 'till you make it_

I have used R for 15+ year, and want to switch to Julia.
Lots of time I struggle to remember how to do something in Julia which I know exactly how to do in R.

This is my attempt to ease the transistion: implementation of some R functin names in julia.

This package does not export anything in order not to create confusion.
There are some functions names that are shared but with very different meanng.

E.g. the R function `range()` does the same as the julia function `extrema`, whereas the julia function `range` does the same as the R function `seq()`.

The objective is not to be able to run existing R code, and it is the essencial functionality I focus on.
In some cases I chose not to do exactly as R does.

Also many functions and parameters in R contain "." as part of the name. 
This does not work in julia, so I replace the "." with "_". Example: file.info to file_info.

Most functions in R are vectorized, and most junctions in julia are not (relying on broardcast for vectorization). Here most functions are vectorized to stay with the R semantics.

Other good resources for learning R from julia is [John Myles White's list](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/JuliaVsR/blob/master/vocab.csv) building on  Hadley Wickhamâ€™s [R Vocabulary](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html).
